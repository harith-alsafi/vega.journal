\begin{abstract}
    Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
    processing, yet their potential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications
    remains largely untapped. Traditional IoT interfaces often require specialized
    knowledge, creating barriers for non-technical users. We present a modular
    system that leverages LLMs to enable intuitive, natural language control of IoT
    devices, specifically a Raspberry Pi (RPi) connected to various sensors and
    devices. Our solution comprises three key components: a physical circuit with
    input and output devices, an RPi integrating Control Server, and a web
    application integrating LLM logic. Users interact with the system through
    natural language commands, which the LLM interprets to call appropriate
    commands for the RPi. The RPi executes these instructions on the connected
    circuit, with outcomes communicated back to the user via LLM-generated
    responses. We empirically evaluate our system's performance across a range of
    task complexities and user scenarios, demonstrating its ability to handle
    complex, conditional logic without additional RPi-level coding. Our findings
    reveal that LLM-driven IoT control can effectively bridge the gap between
    complex device functionality and user-friendly interaction. We discuss the
    system's scalability, exploring its potential applications in diverse settings
    such as smart homes, industrial monitoring, and educational environments. By
    enabling natural language interaction with IoT devices, our approach not only
    enhances accessibility for non-technical users but also opens new avenues for
    creative and intelligent IoT applications. This research contributes to the
    growing body of work on interactive intelligent systems for IoT, offering
    insights into the design and implementation of LLM-integrated IoT interfaces.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\PARstart{T}{he} evolution of large language models (LLM's) has led to rapid
development in the  realm of intelligent systems. However, the application of
LLM's hasn't been thoroughly explored in internet of things (IoT) and embedded
systems (ESys). Traditionally, the development of IoT systems that seamlessly
adapt to the user's need and tasks poses a considerable challenge. Leveraging
the capabilities of LLMs presents an opportunity to address this challenge and
bridge the gap between technical intricacies and user accessibility.

    Try not to list more than three books or published articles. The format for
    listing publishers of a book within the biography is: title of book
    (publisher name, year) similar to a reference. Current and previous
    research
    interests end the paragraph.

    The third paragraph begins with the author's
    title and last name (e.g., Dr.\ Smith, Prof.\ Jones, Mr.\ Kajor, Ms.\
    Hunter).
    List any memberships in professional societies other than the IEEE.
    Finally,
    list any awards and work for IEEE committees and publications. If a
    photograph is provided, it should be of good quality, and
    professional-looking. Following are two examples of an author's biography.
