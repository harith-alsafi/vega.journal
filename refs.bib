abstract = {Welcome one and all to the 19th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)!We are so pleased to re-welcome the HRI community to Boulder, Colorado, where HRI 2021 would have been held, had the COVID pandemic not interfered. Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40\% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7\%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

  abstract  = {Large-language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in improving human-robot interaction, offering advanced conversational skills and versatility in managing diverse, open-ended user requests in various tasks and domains. Despite the potential to transform human-robot interaction, very little is known about the distinctive design requirements for utilizing LLMs in robots, which may differ from text and voice interaction and vary by task and context. To better understand these requirements, we conducted a user study (n = 32) comparing an LLM-powered social robot against text- and voice-based agents, analyzing task-based requirements in conversational tasks, including choose, generate, execute, and negotiate. Our findings show that LLM-powered robots elevate expectations for sophisticated non-verbal cues and excel in connection-building and deliberation, but fall short in logical communication and may induce anxiety. We provide design implications both for robots integrating LLMs and for fine-tuning LLMs for use with robots.},

  abstract   = {Smart home assistants function best when user commands are direct and well-specified---e.g., "turn on the kitchen light"---or when a hard-coded routine specifies the response. In more natural communication, however, human speech is unconstrained, often describing goals (e.g., "make it cozy in here" or "help me save energy") rather than indicating specific target devices and actions to take on those devices. Current systems fail to understand these under-specified commands since they cannot reason about devices and settings as they relate to human situations. We introduce large language models (LLMs) to this problem space, exploring their use for controlling devices and creating automation routines in response to under-specified user commands in smart homes. We empirically study the baseline quality and failure modes of LLM-created action plans with a survey of age-diverse users. We find that LLMs can reason creatively to achieve challenging goals, but they experience patterns of failure that diminish their usefulness. We address these gaps with Sasha, a smarter smart home assistant. Sasha responds to loosely-constrained commands like "make it cozy" or "help me sleep better" by executing plans to achieve user goals---e.g., setting a mood with available devices, or devising automation routines. We implement and evaluate Sasha in a hands-on user study, showing the capabilities and limitations of LLM-driven smart homes when faced with unconstrained user-generated scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Large language models excel at a wide range of complex tasks. However, enabling general inference in the real world, e.g. for robotics problems, raises the challenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multimodal sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internetscale language, vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.},

abstract = {Future software systems will be intelligent and adaptive. They will have the ability to seamlessly integrate with smart applications that have not been explicitly designed to work together. Traditional software engineering approaches offer limited support for the development of intelligent systems. To handle the tremendous complexity and the new engineering challenges presented by intelligence, adaptiveness and seamless integration, developers need higher-level development constructs. Agent concepts are natural to describe intelligent adaptive systems. Agent-based technologies have been incorporating software engineering practices, and have matured to offer useful insights and concrete practices to mainstream software engineers. This tutorial presents the state of the art in agent development from a software engineering perspective, focusing on practices that are applicable today. We have walked the audience through analysis, design and verification of a portion of a real-world problem, a smart home network. We show how agent concepts more naturally match the engineering challenges of such systems like trust between adaptive components. The audience had a hands-on experience with analyzing, and designing parts of the smart home network and learn how to incorporate agent technologies into their current projects.},

As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community.

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) redefines the way how commodity and industrial tasks are performed every day. The integration of sensors, lightweight computation, and the proliferation of different wireless technologies on IoT platforms enable human beings to easily interact with their surrounding physical world thoroughly. With the recent rise of IoT, several different IoT platforms have been introduced for researchers and developers to ease the management and control of various IoT devices. In general, the IoT platforms act as a bridge between core IoT functionalities and users by providing APIs. Due to their wide variety of applications, IoT platforms are mostly unique in their architectures and designs. Thus, IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) are challenged with substantial configuration differences in the proper configuration, implementation, and protection of the IoT solutions. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth analysis of popular IoT platforms from different application domains. More specifically, we define a comprehensive evaluation framework that considers seven different technical comparison criteria: (1) topology design, (2) programming languages, (3) third-party support, (4) extended protocol support, (5) event handling, (6) security, and (7) privacy. Then, we use the framework to evaluate the different IoT platforms highlighting their distinguishing attributes on communications, security, and privacy. First, we describe the communication protocols supported by the different IoT platforms surveyed. Then, rather than uncovering novel threats affecting IoT, we aim to analyze how the different IoT platforms handle security and privacy vulnerabilities affecting the most common security services of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and access control. Further, we present possible solutions that these platforms could implement to strengthen security and privacy within the IoT solution. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of every IoT platform, so IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) can make an informed decision on the use of specific platforms to implement their IoT solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to evaluate different IoT platforms using the criteria defined in this work.}

  abstract = {When robots perform long action sequences, users will want to easily and reliably find out what they have done. We therefore demonstrate the task of learning to summarize and answer questions about a robot agent's past actions using natural language alone. A single system with a large language model at its core is trained to both summarize and answer questions about action sequences given ego-centric video frames of a virtual robot and a question prompt. To enable training of question answering, we develop a method to automatically generate English-language questions and answers about objects, actions, and the temporal order in which actions occurred during episodes of robot action in the virtual environment. Training one model to both summarize and answer questions enables zero-shot transfer of representations of objects learned through question answering to improved action summarization.},

  abstract       = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging Internet-based architecture, enabling the exchange of data and services in a global network. With the advent of the Internet of Things, more and more devices are connecting to the Internet in order to help people get and share data or program actions. In this paper, we introduce an IoT Agent, a Web application for monitoring and controlling a smart home remotely. The IoT Agent integrates a chat bot that can understand text or voice commands using natural language processing (NLP). With the use of NLP, home devices are more user-friendly and controlling them is easier, since even when a command or question/command is different from the presets, the system understands the user’s wishes and responds accordingly. Our solution exploits several available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), namely: the Dialogflow API for the efficient integration of NLP to our IoT system, the Web Speech API for enriching user experience with voice recognition and synthesis features, MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for the lightweight control of actuators and Firebase for dynamic data storage. This is the most significant innovation it brings: the integration of several third-party APIs and open source technologies into one mash-up, highlighting how a new IoT application can be built today using a multi-tier architecture. We believe that such a tiered architecture can be very useful for the rapid development of smart home applications.},

  abstract = {Task planning systems have been developed to help robots use human knowledge (about actions) to complete long-horizon tasks. Most of them have been developed for ``closed worlds'' while assuming the robot is provided with complete world knowledge. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break theplanner's completeness. Could we leverage the recent advances on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable classical planning systems to deal with novel situations? This paper introduces a novel framework, called COWP, for open-world task planning and situation handling. COWP dynamically augments the robot's action knowledge, including the preconditions and effects of actions, with task-oriented commonsense knowledge. COWP embraces the openness from LLMs, and is grounded to specific domains via action knowledge. For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 1085 execution-time situations. Each situation corresponds to a state instance wherein a robot is potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. Additionally, we have demonstrated COWP using a mobile manipulator. Supplementary materials are available at: https://cowplanning.github.io/},

This provides the ability to sense, process, analyze and infer environmental parameters from natural resources and delicate ecologies to urban environments. The explosion in the number of devices that are connected to the internet has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technological revolution. In these technologies, actuators and sensors incorporate smoothly with the IoT environment. Furthermore, the sensed data is shared through platforms to innovate a common operating picture. This cutting-edge technology is fueled by a diversity of IoT devices that enables technologies such as near field communication, embedded actuator, sensor nodes, radio frequency identification tags, and readers. IoT has emerged from its infancy and has established a fully integrated future internet. Different visions of IoT technologies have been reviewed, however, what emerges currently in this field should be faced and displayed via the research community. In this paper, we are keen to discuss the recent worldwide implementation of IoT, where the prime enabling technologies, recent and future communication protocols and application areas that drive IoT research in the near future are explored. Furthermore, the original, recent, future enhancements of all IoT stack's protocols are extensively discussed. Middleware's definition, usages, types and open research challenges are further illustrated. Not only to this extent but rather, this survey details the simulation tools of IoT networks, IoT sensors along with their recent application areas, broad IoT research challenges, as well as in-depth analysis of IoT research history and recommendations that attract current IoT researchers' attention.}

Given a natural language instruction, our framework constructs both a task- and motion-level plan that is verified to reach inferred symbolic goals. Text2Motion uses feasibility heuristics encoded in Q-functions of a library of skills to guide task planning with Large Language Models. Whereas previous language-based planners only consider the feasibility of individual skills, Text2Motion actively resolves geometric dependencies spanning skill sequences by performing geometric feasibility planning during its search. We evaluate our method on a suite of problems that require long-horizon reasoning, interpretation of abstract goals, and handling of partial affordance perception. Our experiments show that Text2Motion can solve these challenging problems with a success rate of 82{\%}, while prior state-of-the-art language-based planning methods only achieve 13{\%}. Text2Motion thus provides promising generalization characteristics to semantically diverse sequential manipulation tasks with geometric dependencies between skills.

ABSTRACT = {The article is dedicated to the development of a mathematical model and methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of integrating information technology solutions into digital platforms using virtual simulation infrastructures. The task of selecting a stack of technologies is formulated as the task of selecting elements from sets of possible solutions. This allows us to develop a mathematically unified approach to evaluating the effectiveness of different solutions, such as choosing programming languages, choosing Database Management System (DBMS), choosing operating systems and data technologies, and choosing the frameworks used. Introduced technology compatibility operation and decomposition of the evaluation of the efficiency of the technology stack at the stages of the life cycle of the digital platform development allowed us to reduce the computational complexity of the formation of the technology stack. A methodology based on performance assessments for experimental research in a virtual software-configurable simulation environment has been proposed. The developed solution allows the evaluation of the performance of the digital platform before its final implementation, while reducing the cost of conducting an experiment to assess the characteristics of the digital platform. It is proposed to compare the characteristics of digital platform efficiency based on the use of fuzzy logic, providing the software developer with an intuitive tool to support decision-making on the inclusion of the solution in the technology stack.},

  abstract = {Task planning can require defining myriad domain knowledge about the world in which a robot needs to act. To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed.

  abstract = {For a robot to personalize physical assistance effectively, it must learn user preferences that can be generally reapplied to future scenarios. In this work, we investigate personalization of household cleanup with robots that can tidy up rooms by picking up objects and putting them away. A key challenge is determining the proper place to put each object, as people's preferences can vary greatly depending on personal taste or cultural background. For instance, one person may prefer storing shirts in the drawer, while another may prefer them on the shelf. We aim to build systems that can learn such preferences from just a handful of examples via prior interactions with a particular person. We show that robots can combine language-based planning and perception with the few-shot summarization capabilities of large language models to infer generalized user preferences that are broadly applicable to future interactions. This approach enables fast adaptation and achieves 91.2{\%} accuracy on unseen objects in our benchmark dataset. We also demonstrate our approach on a real-world mobile manipulator called TidyBot, which successfully puts away 85.0{\%} of objects in real-world test scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {There are a dozen messaging protocols proposed for IoT systems. Choosing one for a new design is complicated, and a non-optimal selection can result in slower development and higher design costs. This paper aims to help select appropriate protocols, considering IoT applications’ specificity and communication requirements. We have identified the protocol features that are significant for the design and operation of IoT systems. This paper gives a substantial comparison of the protocols using the features and is based on a thorough analysis of the protocol specifications. The results contain an assessment of the suitability of the protocols for the defined types of IoT devices and the identified communication purposes. We conclude the comparison with some recommendations of the protocol selection and usage.},

This will involve billions of connections and smart products communicating with each other mostly without human intervention to achieve smart objectives. The idea of IoT has enticed significant research attentions since the massive connectivity bring varieties of challenges and obstacles including heterogeneity, scalability, security, big data, energy requirements, etc. The paper looks into providing a concise review of the concepts on IoT and applications describing the main components and features. Furthermore, open issues and challenges that need addressing by the research community and some potential solutions are discussed.},

abstract = {In autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems, passengers will solely interact with autonomous vehicles via digital user interfaces (UIs). Hence, UIs are crucial for acceptance and user experience (UX). As a foundation for deriving empirically grounded design guidelines, we investigate two approaches for mobile interaction: chatbots and ‘classic’ graphical UIs (GUIs). We evaluated prototypes of both in expert studies (nGUI&nbsp;=&nbsp;6; nChatbot&nbsp;=&nbsp;5) and a between-subjects simulator user study (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;34). The latter enabled participants to experience a complete AMoD journey. While both concepts receive good acceptance and positive UX evaluations, the GUI results in significantly higher attractiveness and user satisfaction ratings. A significant interaction effect reveals a higher intention to use the chatbot in scenarios with a change of plans, but the GUI in ‘happy path’ scenarios. Interview data and emotion curves support this effect. Balancing the concepts‘ advantages and disadvantages, we provide design recommendations and propose to use GUI-based mobile applications with integrated (text-based) conversational elements for future human-AMoD interaction.},

While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we highlight other ingredients. Good conversation requires blended skills: providing engaging talking points, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, while maintaining a consistent persona. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models outperform existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue on engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing failure cases of our models.",

It not only provides a more reliable, real-time and secure communications, but also enables the smart factory concept in the fourth industrial revolution to be realized. However, in the current literature, there is still a lack of a formal and objective review that specifically focuses on this topic. This paper aims to address this gap. First, the applied systematic literature review method is explained. Findings and insights are then illustrated through the analysis of the collected data related to the four research questions. Finally, the strengths and limitations of the work are summarized.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at:},
